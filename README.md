# fraud-transaction-detection
This project deals with modeling past credit card transactions with the data of the ones that turned out to be fraud. It is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. Aim of this project here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.
